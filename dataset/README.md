# What will dataset?

A dataset for AI training is a collection of labeled data that is used to train machine learning models.
It consists of input data (features) and corresponding output labels or target values. The dataset serves
as a training resource for the model, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

Creating a high-quality and diverse dataset is crucial for training accurate and robust AI models.
The dataset should be representative of the real-world scenarios the model will encounter to ensure
its effectiveness in making predictions or performing tasks.
