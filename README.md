# aikdocs

The aikdocs project aims to build a smart knowledge base by training those docs from CNCF projects with ChatGPT.

All are starting from a scratch currently. We welcome all contributors from anywhere.

The efforts of the initial roadmap include:

1. Create a [docs-pool](./pool/README.md) from all docs of CNCF projects
1. Build a model to train those docs
1. Provide a web portal to be easily used by anyone
